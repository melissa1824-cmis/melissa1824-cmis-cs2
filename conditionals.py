#My game will be like Monopoly. You choose a city for yourself and your opponent. Each city has a different value (random value generated = how much the city is worth in dollars). If you choose a city with a higher value, you win. If not, you lose. 

def choose(city):
    if city == "New York":
        strength = int(10,000,000,000)
    elif city == "Los Angeles" 
        strength = int(90,000,000,000)
    elif city == "New Orleans"
        strength = int(80,000,000,000)
    elif city
